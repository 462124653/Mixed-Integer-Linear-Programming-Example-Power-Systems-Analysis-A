The Challenge

Two generators (G1 and G2) are competing to supply a 60MW load. The bidding information of the two generators is shown in Table 1 for G1 and in Table 2 for G2. The minimum and maximum capacities for G1 are 15MW and 65MW, respectively. The minimum and maximum capacities for G2 are 10MW and 80MW, respectively. 

Assume each unit has a no-load cost. No-load cost for G1 is $100. No-load cost for G2 is $200.

Deliverables

Find the minimum cost to supply the load and the accepted quantities for G1 and G2. Formulate the problem using mixed-integer linear programming. 
 
• Complete MILP formulation (variables, objective function, constraints, bounds) 
• Optimal solutions (commitment of units, accepted quantities, cost to supply the load) 

Hints 

• It’s possible that only one unit is needed to supply the load. 
• If a unit is committed, a no-load cost will be incurred. 
• Cost curve for G1 is convex when it’s committed. Cost curve for G2 is non-convex when it’s committed.
